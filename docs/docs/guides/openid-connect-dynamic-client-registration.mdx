title: OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
---

Ory Hydra is capable of exposing [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html).
This feature allows anonymous users to create OAuth2 Clients in self-service, without administrative privileges.

This is particularly useful if you are running a public service and want users to be able to create their own OAuth2 clients easily.

To enable this feature, set the following configuration option:

```yaml
oidc:
  dynamic_client_registration:
    enabled: true
```

Enabling this feature will add listeners to the following four routes at the public endpoint:

- `POST /openid/register` - Register a new OAuth2 Client;
- `GET /openid/register?client_id=...` - Fetch the OAuth2 Client;
- `PUT /openid/register?client_id=...` - Update the OAuth2 Client;
- `DELETE /openid/register?client_id=...` - Delete the OAuth2 Client;

## Register OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Clients

If OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration is enabled, registering a new OAuth2 Client is as simple as:

```
POST /openid/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id": "...",
  ...
}
```

Please note that it is not possible to set OAuth2 Client Metadata using this endpoint. Metadata is a protected
field and can only be set using the administrative endpoint! OAuth2 Client Metadata can also not be read using OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration endpoints!

## Manage OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Clients

All endpoints except the `POST` one require the client to authenticate with its primary credentials. For example,
if the OAuth2 Client has `token_endpoint_auth_method=client_secret_basic` then it will require the client to authenticate
using basic authorization when, for example, updating information:

```
PUT /openid/register?client_id=...
Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "redirect_uris": [...]
  ...
}
```

If the OAuth2 Client uses `client_secret_post` as the auth method, you need to supply the client secret as a query parameter:

```
PUT /openid/register?client_id=...&client_secret=...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "redirect_uris": [...]
  ...
}
```

If the OAuth2 Client uses `private_key_jwt` as the auth method, you supply the appropriate assertion as a query parameter as well:

```
PUT /openid/register?client_id=...&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer&client_assertion=...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "redirect_uris": [...]
  ...
}
```

:::info

It is not possible to manage the OAuth2 Clients with `token_endpoint_auth_method=none` through the API! These clients can only be managed
using administrative endpoints.
